## Atom: The Hackable Text Editor
### About Atom
Atom is a hackable text editor from GitHub for the 21st century. It was designed to be highly customizable while maintaining general approachability using the default configuration. It has been highly accepted within the open source science community thanks to its 'simple core' and the options it provides users. Specifically, its operational basis rests on a simple-to-use platform with core features and settings that most users likely will want, and then provides a wide range of customizability for users looking to get more out of it. Jono Bacon specifies below:

"*Atom provides a powerful framework that allows pretty much any part of Atom to be changed and expanded. This functionality is then exposed in a package system so these customizations easily can be created, shared, installed, updated, and configured. There are packages for key-bindings, code review, color selection, user interface changes, GitHub integration, and more.*"

### Community and development
Like any other open source project, Atom is well supported by its active community. You can connect with other users and the Atom community through GitHub, Discuss, and Slack.
